What's changed?
How?
Why?

# What?

A framework for creating desktop apps with web technologies

![h:400px](images/electron-and-chrome.png)

---

# Why?

* Build genuinely cross-platform applications
* Deploy changes to apps without requiring user installation
* Chromium APIs in your front-end code
* Node APIs in the back-end code
* Lots of APIs provided by Electron for system integration
  - power management, storage, Tray/Menu, TouchBar ü§™

# How?
_Show and tell time_

### Twang: The cross-platform guitar tuner

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Act 2
A wretched hive of scum and villainy

# Process model

![w:1100](images/chrome-processes.png)

Process model is based on Chrom(e|ium)

![h:500](images/electron-process-model.svg)

Message passing via: Inter Process Communication (IPC)

<!--
Inter process communication allows messages and data 
to be passed between isolated processes and between processes
of differing privlege levels
-->

# It's Node but not as we know it

- Diagrams of the processes

# What danger lurks within?

‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous Electron example ‚ö†Ô∏è


<!-- You can avoid this by setting nodeIntegration: true -->

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Act 3
Stay on target!

---

# Security upgrades

**April 2019: v5**
Changing default `nodeIntegration` setting to `false`
Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration upgrades

**March 2021: v12**
Enable `contextIsolation` by default

**August 2021: v14**
Removing `remote` module

---
# Remote module

What you used to able to do in your webContent (front-end) code:
```
const { systemPreferences } = require('electron').remote
systemPreferences.getMediaAccessStatus('microphone')
```

---

**August 2022: v20**
Sandboxing enabled by default

---

# Use the safety net: Preload

üîê Configure the app securely

üìû Load a script defining the API your FE code can use to access the the main process

‚û° Dive into the _Twang_ code for examples

<!-- Refer the Twang example here with the mic permissions -->

---

# Operating with the OS

üñ• Electron APIs for OS specific functions

üç¥ Forking other processes

# Alternatives

- Tauri
- Wails
- neutralino.js
- Flutter

# Things I would have like to talked more about

- Profiling
- Organising code for true cross-platform apps: web, desktop, mobile
